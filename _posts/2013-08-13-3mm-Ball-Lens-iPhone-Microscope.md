Ordered a 3mm Ball Lens and mounted it to an iPhone (w/ tape). An article in the [American Journal of Tropical Medicine](http://www.ajtmh.org/content/early/2013/03/07/ajtmh.12-0742.full.pdf+html) and covered by a bunch of news sources, discusses how a scientist was able to diagnose a stomach worm in the field using a 3mm ball lens taped to an iPhone.

The idea is to see if I can build an Open-Source [3D printed holder](https://github.com/mmassie/3MM-iPhone-Microsope) for this lens to clip on an iPhone. This would cheaply allow doctors in these areas to either print of have printed a more practical holder
