As the second screen evolves into how we engage with big screen content

[_"Today 90% of our media consumption occurs in front of a screen.” - Think w/Google_](http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/insights/featured/new-multi-screen-world-insight/)

Of all the digital things that I interact with, they all share one common denominator = the web.  We can all think of plenty of situations for using a mobile device as a second screen to interact with content on a larger, TV screen sized, webpage - like Airplay - but I don’t know one that are supported over every platform.
