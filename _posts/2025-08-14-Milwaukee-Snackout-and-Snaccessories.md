![Snackout](https://michaelmassie.com/assets/img/snackout01.jpeg)

A couple months ago I had a desire to have a to-go box for charcuterie to bring to a bike and coffee social group (Scrappy Hour). i had seen, a while back, a Washington MTB outfitter that offered "Snackouts" for rides - a Milwaukee Tool Packout Low-Profile Compact Organizer full of snacks like beef jerky, trail mix, and nuts. I loved that idea and thought these 2 concepts could come together... only thing missing was a cutting/serving board. Researched some Milwaukee Packout cleat designs to 3D print and mount to the back of the cutting board. Put it all together after cutting the board to fit the top and tada it was kinda done. I had a fast deadline to the next ride date so i skipped trying to get time on a laser cutter to burn in "Snackout" and opted for using synthetic oil of wintergreen to transfer the ink off a inverse laserjet print. I thought it was pretty done at that point but then realized I was in need of other snaccessories like a cheese knife and bottle opener. Back to the drawing board to design and print a center bin tray insert that could keep them both securely in place. Day before ride day I mounted a Packout wall mount to my front bike rack so that the Snackout and Cutting board could all click in securely for the ride. It all worked great except one thing... it was sweltering out and the cheese was sweaty... Kenny made a comment about finding a way to add a chiller or ice block. We batted around some ideas like another Packout under it full of ice packs and other options.

What I landed on was pulling out the middle bin again and custom making an ice block. This part went far better than i anticipated. i had only one concern - will it keep the coolant liquid and will it bust once frozen. decided to try the soft sided gel packs due to the fact that I saw by far the least expansion and contraction between a hot and cold state; most ice blocks i had seen belly out considerably when frozen. Cutting a gel pack and feeding it into my final prototype was the equivalent of putting toothpaste back into a tube... it was where good times go to die. That said, once it was in, cap went on with a health dose of super glue and into the freezer it went. Not only did it work, it worked perfectly. I want to make more accessories, for instance i would like a toothpick tray. napkin holder, etc, but for now I am calling this done. It's been mounted to a bike, a kayak, tossed in the passenger seat and used on a SUP board like a buffet table - Oh the places we will go!

Here are the print files if you want one for yourself or have ideas on how to improve on what I have done.
