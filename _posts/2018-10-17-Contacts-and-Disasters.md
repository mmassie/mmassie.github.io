Took an adaptation from a work R&D prototype and gave it a personal spin. With friends on both coasts, I dumped my Address Book into Google Earth and then loaded all natural disaster data - from hurricanes, earthquakes, to wild fires on NOAA, USDF, etc - to check-in to make sure friends are far from danger.

Glad to see and hear you're safe, Jon!
