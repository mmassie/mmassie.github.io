I'm excited to share that Northwester Mutual has given me the OK to Open Source the Object Class Association card game.

The goal of this effort was to make an engaging card game around data hierarchy targeting the 5 to 8-year-old demographic without all the assumptions of access to a computer and internet while also being mindful of screen time.

Please consider contributing the the game mechanics. We're close but it's still a little rough on the onboarding.
