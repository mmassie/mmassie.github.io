In keeping an eye on the sizable dip in air pollution across cities during the COVID-19 outbreak. I keep coming back to the environmental sensors in the original concept [Copenhagen Wheel](http://senseable.mit.edu/copenhagenwheel/urbanData.html). While it had service limitations that kept it from its final version, it would be awesome to see companies like Trek Bicycle putting NOx, CO, and other sensors into their city share fleets to offer to municipalities a long-term hyperlocal eye on pollutions in our cities.
