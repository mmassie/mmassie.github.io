This week we piloted our Object Association Card Game with the Girls Who Code of Shorewood High School last night. We had 4 games going 3 of which were students. The students provided tons of great feedback and they generally seemed to enjoy the game. Excited that this little side project is growing up and providing a fun way to learn that overcomes assumptions like easy access to a computer and the internet.
