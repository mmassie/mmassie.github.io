This year I designed and 3D printed some tools for Fall Experiment. The tool was intended as a non-sharp cardboard punch to help the student participants build a vehicle during our instructor lead event. How the kids actually used the tools is beyond anything that I had anticipated. It's extremely exciting to see the ingenuity of these students using anything in their toolkit to achieve their goal.
