## A Backseat Tablet Holder 3D Print

For those with kiddos, I thought I'd share the print file for a simple hanger for the backseat of the Rivian to hold one of the more popular kids iPad/Tablet cases. 

There is a cutout in the hanger arm so the USB-C is accessable as well as the hanger arm is extended slightly to allow you to wrap the excess cable around. There is a small gap in back that where the hanger slides into the notch on the car seat,  where i've added a rubber adhesive backed tab to protect the plastic from scratching.

Also if you don't have a 3D printer, I'd recommend [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/).

Lemme know if you'd see any opportunities for improvement.
