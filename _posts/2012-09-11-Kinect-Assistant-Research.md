The capabilities of computer vision and it's application with assistance seem almost infinite. I wanted to explore how these assistance could be applied to the kitchen and assist the user with cooking.

None of this is wired up, just using a Processing Sketch to pull in the feed from a kinect. The expection being that with AI that the camera could discern the cooking tools like the measuring cup and understand fill.
